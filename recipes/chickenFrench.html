        <h2>Succulent Chicken French (Rochester, NY Style)</h2>
        <p>This is a Chicken French recipe I've been making for years, and it is one of my family's most requested meals. Serve with brown and wild rice or rice pilaf along with Italian-cut green beans. Garnish with lemon slices, if desired.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>¼ cup dry sherry</li>
            <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons low-sodium chicken base</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together flour, salt, and pepper in a shallow bowl. Whisk beaten eggs, sugar, and Parmesan cheese in another bowl until the mixture is thoroughly blended and the sugar has dissolved.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until the oil shimmers. Dip chicken breasts into the flour mixture, then into the egg mixture, and gently lay them into the skillet.
                 Pan-fry chicken breasts until golden brown and no longer pink in the middle, about 6 minutes on each side. Remove from the skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same skillet over medium-low heat, melt butter, and stir in garlic. Add sherry, lemon juice, and chicken base. Bring the sauce to a simmer,
                 and stir until smooth and slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Be sure to dissolve any brown flavor bits from the bottom of the skillet as you stir.</li>
            <li>Return chicken breasts to the sauce, and gently simmer for about 15 minutes. To serve, place a chicken breast on a plate, and top with sauce.</li>
        </ol>
